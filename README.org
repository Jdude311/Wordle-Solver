* Wordle Solver
Solves wordle (mostly) for you. Suggests the best wordle word based on the number of occurrences of letters in certain positions in words.

Has never failed me in about 50-60 trials in [[https://wordleunlimited.com][Wordle Unlimited]] and about 3 on regular Wordle, although there are sometimes close calls when you get a lot of words with the same structure and one different letter since its strategy is to have the max probability of getting green squares.

I know that the code is a burning pile of trash. I threw this together in like a few hours here and there in between classes.
